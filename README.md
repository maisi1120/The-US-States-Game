# Overview
This project is developed using Python and `turtle` and `pandas` module and it helps users see which states they know or still need to learn.

# Instructions
Enter the names of states, and the program will dynamically display their corresponding locations on the screen if they exist. Following each input, a pop-up dialog will present a title that calculates and showcases the number of correct answers the user has achieved. After completing the interactive session, the system will generate a comprehensive list, providing a detailed breakdown of the states that users are yet to familiarize themselves with, offering an insightful overview of their learning progress.
